In this project, I have done some explanatory data analysis for 3 data sets:
- Winter Olympic Games ds
- Summer Olympic Games ds
- ds with GDP and population information of countries that are Olympic Games participants  


The following steps are taken:
- data import and inspection
- merging and concatenating data sets
- data cleaning
- identifying what countries are the most successful 
- finding out what features are the most important
- statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- recognizing "traditional" sports in most successful countries

Libraries imported:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy.stats
